_\*Version 2.0 is still in `beta`, not all features are ported from 1.0. Check below for details ðŸ‘‡_

## Basic

```
https://api.swo.moe
```

You request:

```http
GET /stats/:source/:key
```

I respond:

```typescript
{
  source: string,
  key: string,
  failed: true | false,
  count: number | string  // Most often it's a number when source !== 'common'
}
```

Yep, it's that simple now. ;)

_\*Note that `key` needs to be url encoded, remember this if you are requesting the `feedly`, `inoreader`, or `feedspub` routes._

## Advanced <Badge colorScheme="purple">New!</Badge>

What if the source you are trying to use is not supported yet, but it's just a simple `GET` request? In this case, you can use the route:

```http
GET /stats/common?endpoint=<url>&datapath=<path>
```

Such as:

```http
GET /stats/common/?endpoint=https://api.genshin.dev/domains/cecilia-garden&datapath=rewards.0.details.2.mora
```

In this case, the `endpoint` is an API url:

```
https://api.genshin.dev/domains/cecilia-garden
```

The response this URL returns looks like:

```json
{
  "name": "Cecilia Garden",
  "type": "Forgery",
  // ...
  "rewards": [
    {
      "details": [
        {
          /* ... */
        },
        {
          /* ... */
        },
        {
          "mora": 1125
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Hence, we provide the `datapath` as `rewards.0.details.2.mora`. (I specifically chose this data as it contains an array to demonstrate how to reference the value `mora` inside the array by index.)

Response from the `endpoint` provided by you is parsed with [object-path](https://github.com/mariocasciaro/object-path), and the method for constructing a reference `datapath` to your value in the response is the same.
