# What's new?

Yes, `substats` is now version `v2.0-beta`! Most of the updates are under-the-hood apart from API formats.

- Refactored in TypeScript.
- Updated to CloudFlare's module workers.
- Worker is built with `esbuild` instead of `webpack`, etra fast!
- Support for Newsblur has been deprecated ~~(seems nobody uses it)~~.
- KV storages are now supported, some routes including `instagram` and `inoreader` depends on this for storing cookies (wip).
- Caching is ported to module workers in 2.0 and supported as always.
- New documentation and query builder.

If you are looking for the multiple source and query functions in 2.0 - it's still under refactor, as `itty-router` does not parse multiple query parameters, blocking this feature here. You can still use the 1.0 route while we wait. [README and documentation for v1.0 (deprecated)](https://github.com/spencerwooo/substats/blob/1becc576f09b09cfa1389312d081f02a25ed0735/README.md).
